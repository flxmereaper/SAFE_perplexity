      "side2_response": "Jacques Derrida (1930–2004) was a French philosopher and founder of deconstruction, a method exposing how Western thought relies on unstable oppositions and shifting meanings. Born in Algeria to a Sephardic Jewish family, he faced anti‑Semitism before moving to France in 1952 to study at the École Normale Supérieure. Influenced by Husserl, Heidegger, and Saussure, he critiqued structuralism and phenomenology and taught at the Sorbonne, ENS, EHESS, and later at the University of California, Irvine. He authored over 40 books, including Of Grammatology and Writing and Difference (1967), shaping philosophy, literature, law, and linguistics. A co‑founder of the Collège international de philosophie, Derrida was also an activist for dissident scholars. He died in Paris in 2004, aged 74."
